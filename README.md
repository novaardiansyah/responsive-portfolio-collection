## Responsive Portfolio Collection
This repo contains a collection of many portfolios that I create over time, with a wide variety of technologies that I know about.

here I try to create a portfolio ranging from the simplest, to the complicated.

ranging from simple in terms of the look / front-end of the website, simple in the back-end, to the complicated in both.

since I am still a beginner and I made this project solely for learning, of course there will be a lot of shortcomings, for that I am very open if friends can contribute to my project.
